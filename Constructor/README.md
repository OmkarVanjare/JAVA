#  Constructors in JAVA
		  Constructor is a similar block that has the same name as that class.
		  The constructor does not have a return type.
		  Only 4 modifiers are applicable 1. public 2. protected 3. default 4. private. 
		  Constructed is used to initialize an object and not to create an object.
		  There are three types of constructors.
		  1. Default constructor which is created by the compiler.
		  2. No argument constructor (created by the programmer).
		  3. Parameterized constructor (used in this example) created by  the programmer.
